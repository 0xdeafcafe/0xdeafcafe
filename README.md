## Hey, I'm Alex 👋

I'm a **Full Stack Engineer** from **London, UK**, but based in **Amsterdam, NL**. Navigating the spicy world of AI trying to avoid writing as much Python as I can. 

### Currently...

- 🏢 I’m working as a **Senior Full Stack Engineer** in the AI startup space.
- 🐡 I'm hacking on a 💅 *stylish* 💅 local and mutli-modal AI assistant with API over at [0xdeafcafe/bloefish](https://github.com/0xdeafcafe/bloefish).
- 🐦 I'm also sometimes building a feathery API crafting tool over at [getbeak/beak](https://github.com/getbeak/beak).
